<p>
	This is the old Otaki/Arii Spitfire.  I did this in the RAAF markings of Clive Caldwell.
</p>
<p>
	The decals went on horribly.  Also, I can't remember how many things I screwed up on this kit.
</p>
<p>
	Edit: Looking at this several years later (May 2015), I note that the fuselage band
	and spinner are Sky.  They should be white, to match the leading edge of the wings.

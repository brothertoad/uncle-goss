<p>
  I'm Uncle Uncool.  Welcome to my web site!  It is primarily devoted to my
  plastic models, but I may add other uncool stuff at some point.
  I built models as a boy, and took up the hobby again
  in April of 2006.
</p>
<p>
  If you've visited other plastic model sites on the web, you've
  probably seen some fantastic work.  I know I have.  Sorry to say, you won't
  see anything like that here.  Although I'm a very enthusiastic
  modeler, and enjoy it tremendously, I'll be the first to admit that
  I'm not all that great at it, even after almost twenty years back at it.
  I am also a very casual modeler.  It is rare that I do
  any more research into a subject than reading the kit instructions,
  and I still haven't tried to weather any of my airplanes (although I
  do attempt to weather my armor builds).

  You can peruse my completions on my {{f.linkTo('builds page','builds/')}}.

  Here are some photos of my work area.

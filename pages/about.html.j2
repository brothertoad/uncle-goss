<h3>
  The domain
</h3>
<p>
  I am a member of {{f.linkTo('ARC',"http://www.arcair.com/")}},
  where my user name is zeus60.
  There was another member whose user name was Uncle Uncool. I was so impressed
  by his moniker that I asked him if he had a web site, and, if not, if he would
  mind if I used his user name as a domain name. He did not have a web site and was gracious enough
  to let me use the name. Since I am an uncle, and not a dad, and am very uncool,
  I thought it fitting.

<h3>
  The web site
</h3>
<p>
  This is a static web site, created with {{f.linkTo('goss',"https://github.com/brothertoad/goss")}},
  a static site generation I wrote using {{f.linkTo('golang',"https://go.dev/")}}.
  The source code for this site is available on
  {{f.linkTo('github',"https://github.com/brothertoad/uncle-goss")}}.
  The web pages themselves are hosted on
  {{f.linkTo("Google's Firebase",'https://firebase.google.com')}},
  the images are hosted on
  {{f.linkTo('Amazon S3','https://aws.amazon.com/s3/')}},
  and the email is handled by
  {{f.linkTo('Zoho Mail','https://www.zoho.com/mail/')}}.
  Goss uses {{f.linkTo('gonja',"https://github.com/noirbizarre/gonja")}} templates.
  Gonja is an implementation of the
  {{f.linkTo('jinja2',"https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/")}} template engine,
  written in golang.
  The stylesheets are written in {{f.linkTo('Sass','https://sass-lang.com/')}}.

  This site was originally created using

  to {{f.linkTo("Metalsmith","https://metalsmith.io/")}}
  in June 2020 and then migrated to goss in June 2023.

<p>
	Another undocumented build.  I wish I remembered what paint I used for the NMF -
	it isn't half bad by my standards.  It was probably Polly Scale Flat Aluminum,
	from the railroad colors.  I have an aftermarket decal set that thas this
	subject on it, and I plan to use it with the Tamiya kit at some point.
